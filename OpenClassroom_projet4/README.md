The application is a chess tournament management system that aim to play
a chess tournament. The goal is not to play chess but to manage chess matches
in the real life. In other word, the application is not a chess game. The 
application is a system that let the user register the score of players when
a chess match is finished. In the application, we implement the swiss 
tournament system. The swiss tournament system is a system where each player
plays with a player that has the same level of him. Furthermore, two players
should never meet each other twice during a tournament.
